== Lab: Object-Oriented Programming in Python

=== Objective
Provide a comprehensive guide to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python by:

1. Introducing OOP concepts and principles.
2. Explaining key features: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
3. Demonstrating these concepts with detailed examples and a real-world case study.

=== Step 1: Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods).

#### Key Features of OOP
1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class).
2. **Inheritance**: Enabling a new class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (parent).
3. **Polymorphism**: Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
4. **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionality.

=== Step 2: Encapsulation

#### What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation ensures that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside world, and access is controlled through methods (getters and setters).

[source,python]
----
# Example: Encapsulation
class InsurancePolicy:
    def __init__(self, policy_id, policy_holder, premium):
        self.__policy_id = policy_id  # Private attribute
        self.policy_holder = policy_holder
        self.__premium = premium  # Private attribute

    # Getter for premium
    def get_premium(self):
        return self.__premium

    # Setter for premium
    def set_premium(self, new_premium):
        if new_premium > 0:
            self.__premium = new_premium
        else:
            print("Invalid premium value.")

# Test Encapsulation
policy = InsurancePolicy("POL12345", "John Doe", 1500)
print("Premium:", policy.get_premium())
policy.set_premium(2000)
print("Updated Premium:", policy.get_premium())
policy.set_premium(-500)  # Invalid value
----

=== Step 3: Inheritance

#### What is Inheritance?
Inheritance allows a class to acquire the properties and methods of another class.

[source,python]
----
# Example: Inheritance
class Policy:
    def __init__(self, policy_id, policy_holder):
        self.policy_id = policy_id
        self.policy_holder = policy_holder

    def display_details(self):
        print(f"Policy ID: {self.policy_id}, Holder: {self.policy_holder}")

# Derived class
class HealthPolicy(Policy):
    def __init__(self, policy_id, policy_holder, coverage_amount):
        super().__init__(policy_id, policy_holder)  # Call parent constructor
        self.coverage_amount = coverage_amount

    def display_details(self):
        super().display_details()  # Call parent method
        print(f"Coverage Amount: {self.coverage_amount}")

# Test Inheritance
health_policy = HealthPolicy("HP12345", "Jane Smith", 500000)
health_policy.display_details()
----

=== Step 4: Polymorphism

#### What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism allows methods in different classes to have the same name but behave differently.

[source,python]
----
# Example: Polymorphism
class VehiclePolicy:
    def display_details(self):
        print("Vehicle Policy Details")

class LifePolicy:
    def display_details(self):
        print("Life Policy Details")

# Polymorphic behavior
def show_policy_details(policy):
    policy.display_details()

# Test Polymorphism
vehicle_policy = VehiclePolicy()
life_policy = LifePolicy()
show_policy_details(vehicle_policy)  # Vehicle Policy Details
show_policy_details(life_policy)    # Life Policy Details
----

=== Step 5: Abstraction

#### What is Abstraction?
Abstraction hides the implementation details and provides only essential information to the user.

[source,python]
----
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract Base Class
class AbstractPolicy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_premium(self):
        pass

# Concrete class
class TermPolicy(AbstractPolicy):
    def __init__(self, policy_id, term_years, base_premium):
        self.policy_id = policy_id
        self.term_years = term_years
        self.base_premium = base_premium

    def calculate_premium(self):
        return self.base_premium * self.term_years

# Test Abstraction
term_policy = TermPolicy("TP12345", 10, 1000)
print("Total Premium:", term_policy.calculate_premium())
----

=== Step 6: Real-World Case Study: Insurance Management System

#### Scenario
Build an insurance management system with the following features:
1. Different policy types (Health, Vehicle, Life).
2. Common attributes (policy ID, policy holder).
3. Specific behavior for each policy type.

[source,python]
----
class Policy:
    def __init__(self, policy_id, policy_holder):
        self.policy_id = policy_id
        self.policy_holder = policy_holder

    def calculate_premium(self):
        pass

class HealthPolicy(Policy):
    def __init__(self, policy_id, policy_holder, coverage_amount):
        super().__init__(policy_id, policy_holder)
        self.coverage_amount = coverage_amount

    def calculate_premium(self):
        return self.coverage_amount * 0.02

class VehiclePolicy(Policy):
    def __init__(self, policy_id, policy_holder, vehicle_value):
        super().__init__(policy_id, policy_holder)
        self.vehicle_value = vehicle_value

    def calculate_premium(self):
        return self.vehicle_value * 0.03

class LifePolicy(Policy):
    def __init__(self, policy_id, policy_holder, sum_assured):
        super().__init__(policy_id, policy_holder)
        self.sum_assured = sum_assured

    def calculate_premium(self):
        return self.sum_assured * 0.01

# Test Case Study
policies = [
    HealthPolicy("HP001", "Alice", 500000),
    VehiclePolicy("VP001", "Bob", 300000),
    LifePolicy("LP001", "Charlie", 1000000)
]

for policy in policies:
    print(f"Policy ID: {policy.policy_id}, Premium: {policy.calculate_premium()}")
----

=== Step 7: Summary

- **Encapsulation**: Protect sensitive data using private attributes and controlled access.
- **Inheritance**: Reuse code by deriving new classes from existing ones.
- **Polymorphism**: Enable methods with the same name to work across different classes.
- **Abstraction**: Simplify complex systems by hiding implementation details.
- The case study demonstrates how to use OOP principles in a real-world context.

=== Step 8: Run and Verify

To run the lab, save the code as `oop_lab.py` and execute it using:

[source,bash]
----
python oop_lab.py
----

Verify the outputs match the expected behavior for each policy type.
