== Lab: Python Naming Conventions and PEP8 Guidelines

=== Objective
Provide a comprehensive guide to naming conventions and coding standards in Python, focusing on:

1. Rules for naming various coding artifacts.
2. PEP8 guidelines for maintaining clean and readable code.
3. Examples of best practices and common pitfalls.

=== Step 1: Introduction to PEP8

PEP8 is the official style guide for Python code. It provides conventions for:
- Code layout.
- Naming styles.
- Indentation and line length.
- Spacing, imports, and comments.

=== Step 2: Naming Conventions

==== Variables and Functions
- Use **snake_case** for variable and function names.
- Keep names descriptive and meaningful.

[source,python]
----
# Correct
policy_id = "POL12345"
def calculate_premium(base, risk_factor):
    return base * risk_factor

# Incorrect
PolicyId = "POL12345"
def CalculatePremium(Base, RiskFactor):
    return Base * RiskFactor
----

==== Constants
- Use **ALL_CAPS** for constants.
- Define constants at the top of the file or in a separate configuration file.

[source,python]
----
# Correct
MAX_PREMIUM_LIMIT = 10000
DEFAULT_POLICY_TYPE = "Life"

# Incorrect
maxPremiumLimit = 10000
defaultPolicyType = "Life"
----

==== Classes
- Use **CamelCase** for class names.

[source,python]
----
# Correct
class InsurancePolicy:
    def __init__(self, policy_id, premium):
        self.policy_id = policy_id
        self.premium = premium

# Incorrect
class insurance_policy:
    def __init__(self, policy_id, premium):
        self.policy_id = policy_id
        self.premium = premium
----

==== Methods
- Use **snake_case** for method names within classes.

[source,python]
----
# Correct
class InsurancePolicy:
    def calculate_premium(self, base, risk_factor):
        return base * risk_factor

# Incorrect
class InsurancePolicy:
    def CalculatePremium(self, Base, RiskFactor):
        return Base * RiskFactor
----

==== Modules and Packages
- Use **short_snake_case** for module and package names.

[source,python]
----
# Correct
import policy_calculator

# Incorrect
import PolicyCalculator
----

==== Exceptions
- Use **CamelCase** for exception class names, and suffix them with "Error."

[source,python]
----
# Correct
class PolicyValidationError(Exception):
    pass

# Incorrect
class policy_validation_error(Exception):
    pass
----

=== Step 3: PEP8 Guidelines

==== Indentation
- Use **4 spaces per indentation level**.

[source,python]
----
# Correct
if premium > 1000:
    print("High premium")

# Incorrect
if premium > 1000:
	print("High premium")  # Tab instead of spaces
----

==== Line Length
- Limit lines to **79 characters**.

[source,python]
----
# Correct
policy_description = (
    "This policy provides comprehensive coverage for individuals "
    "aged between 25 and 50 years."
)

# Incorrect
policy_description = "This policy provides comprehensive coverage for individuals aged between 25 and 50 years."
----

==== Spacing
- Add a single space around operators and after commas.

[source,python]
----
# Correct
premium = base_premium * risk_factor

# Incorrect
premium=base_premium*risk_factor
----

==== Imports
- Imports should be grouped as:
  1. Standard library imports.
  2. Related third-party imports.
  3. Local application/library imports.
- Each group should be separated by a blank line.

[source,python]
----
# Correct
import os
import sys

import pytest

from policy_calculator import calculate_premium

# Incorrect
import pytest, os, sys
from policy_calculator import calculate_premium
----

==== Comments
- Use comments to explain **why**, not **what**.
- Use **#** for inline comments and block comments.

[source,python]
----
# Correct
# Calculate premium based on base amount and risk factor.
def calculate_premium(base, risk_factor):
    return base * risk_factor

# Incorrect
# This function calculates the premium.
def calculate_premium(base, risk_factor):
    return base * risk_factor
----

=== Step 4: Real-World Example

[source,python]
----
# Constants
MAX_PREMIUM_LIMIT = 10000
DEFAULT_POLICY_TYPE = "Life"

# Class definition
class InsurancePolicy:
    def __init__(self, policy_id, policy_type, premium):
        self.policy_id = policy_id
        self.policy_type = policy_type
        self.premium = premium

    def is_high_premium(self):
        return self.premium > MAX_PREMIUM_LIMIT

# Function to calculate premium
def calculate_premium(base, risk_factor):
    return base * risk_factor

# Main workflow
if __name__ == "__main__":
    policy = InsurancePolicy("POL12345", DEFAULT_POLICY_TYPE, 12000)
    print(f"Policy ID: {policy.policy_id}, High Premium: {policy.is_high_premium()}")
----

=== Step 5: Summary

- Follow PEP8 for consistent, clean, and readable Python code.
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Group and format imports properly.
- Apply spacing, indentation, and line length guidelines effectively.
- Use comments to clarify intent and avoid redundant explanations.
