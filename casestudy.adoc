== Case Study: Comprehensive Insurance Data Management System

=== Objective
Develop a Python-based insurance data management system utilizing:

1. Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples for data storage and manipulation.
2. Functions for modular and reusable code.
3. Lambda functions for concise data processing.
4. Exception handling for robustness and error management.

=== Scenario: Insurance Policy and Claims Management
Create a system to manage policy details, validate claims, and calculate premiums while ensuring data integrity and error handling.

=== Step 1: Data Storage with Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, and Tuples

[source,python]
----
# List of policy types
policy_types = ["Life", "Health", "Vehicle", "Property"]

# Dictionary of policy details
policy_details = {
    "POL12345": {"holder": "John Doe", "type": "Life", "premium": 1500},
    "POL12346": {"holder": "Jane Smith", "type": "Health", "premium": 2500},
    "POL12347": {"holder": "Jim Brown", "type": "Vehicle", "premium": 3500}
}

# Set of active policies
active_policies = {"POL12345", "POL12346"}

# Tuple of risk categories
risk_categories = ("Low", "Medium", "High")

print("Policy Types:", policy_types)
print("Policy Details:", policy_details)
print("Active Policies:", active_policies)
print("Risk Categories:", risk_categories)
----

=== Step 2: Functions for Policy Management

[source,python]
----
# Function to calculate premium with risk factor

def calculate_premium(base_premium, risk_factor):
    """
    Calculate the premium based on risk factor.
    Arguments:
        base_premium (float): Base premium amount.
        risk_factor (float): Risk multiplier.
    Returns:
        float: Adjusted premium.
    """
    return base_premium * risk_factor

# Function to validate policy

def validate_policy(policy_id, policy_dict):
    """
    Validate if a policy exists in the system.
    Arguments:
        policy_id (str): Policy ID to validate.
        policy_dict (dict): Dictionary of policy details.
    Returns:
        bool: True if valid, False otherwise.
    """
    return policy_id in policy_dict

print("Premium for High Risk:", calculate_premium(2000, 1.5))
print("Is POL12345 a valid policy?:", validate_policy("POL12345", policy_details))
----

=== Step 3: Lambda Functions for Quick Processing

[source,python]
----
# Lambda function to check high premium
is_high_premium = lambda premium: premium > 3000

# Apply lambda to filter high premium policies
high_premium_policies = {policy for policy, details in policy_details.items() if is_high_premium(details["premium"])}

print("High Premium Policies:", high_premium_policies)
----

=== Step 4: Exception Handling for Robustness

[source,python]
----
# Function to safely fetch policy details

def get_policy_details(policy_id, policy_dict):
    """
    Fetch policy details safely with exception handling.
    Arguments:
        policy_id (str): Policy ID to fetch.
        policy_dict (dict): Dictionary of policy details.
    Returns:
        dict: Policy details if found.
    """
    try:
        return policy_dict[policy_id]
    except KeyError:
        print(f"Error: Policy {policy_id} not found.")
        return None

print("Details for POL12345:", get_policy_details("POL12345", policy_details))
print("Details for POL99999:", get_policy_details("POL99999", policy_details))
----

=== Step 5: Combining All Concepts in a Real-World Scenario

[source,python]
----
# Function to process claims

def process_claim(policy_id, claim_amount, policy_dict, active_set):
    """
    Process a claim for a given policy.
    Arguments:
        policy_id (str): Policy ID.
        claim_amount (float): Claim amount.
        policy_dict (dict): Dictionary of policy details.
        active_set (set): Set of active policies.
    Returns:
        str: Result of the claim processing.
    """
    try:
        if policy_id not in active_set:
            raise ValueError(f"Policy {policy_id} is not active.")

        if claim_amount > policy_dict[policy_id]["premium"] * 2:
            return f"Claim for {policy_id} denied: Exceeds allowable limit."

        return f"Claim for {policy_id} approved: ${claim_amount} processed."

    except KeyError:
        return f"Error: Policy {policy_id} not found."
    except ValueError as e:
        return str(e)

# Test the function
print(process_claim("POL12345", 2000, policy_details, active_policies))
print(process_claim("POL12345", 4000, policy_details, active_policies))
print(process_claim("POL12348", 2000, policy_details, active_policies))

=== Step 6: Summary

- This case study demonstrates the combined use of lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples to manage structured data.
- Functions ensure reusability and modularity in the code.
- Lambda functions provide concise processing, while exception handling ensures robust error management.
- The real-world insurance domain example highlights practical applications of Python concepts.
