== Case Study: Functional Programming for BCBS Operations

=== Objective
Implement a functional programming approach to streamline BCBS (Blue Cross Blue Shield) operations, focusing on:

1. Managing hospital and doctor collaboration data.
2. Sharing resources between BCBS companies.
3. Joint enrollment and billing functions.

This case study uses Python's functional programming principles to create reusable, composable, and predictable solutions.

=== Step 1: Defining the Problem

BCBS companies operate in a decentralized model but collaborate in key areas:

1. Maintain a list of hospitals and doctors in a community.
2. Share office space and resources between companies.
3. Conduct joint enrollment and billing for members.

We will solve this using:

- Pure functions for predictable operations.
- Higher-order functions for reusable logic.
- Data immutability to maintain consistent state.

=== Step 2: Setting Up Initial Data

[source,python]
----
# List of hospitals and doctors in the community
hospitals = [
    {"hospital_id": "H001", "name": "Community Hospital", "city": "Springfield"},
    {"hospital_id": "H002", "name": "Central Medical Center", "city": "Rivertown"}
]

doctors = [
    {"doctor_id": "D001", "name": "Dr. Smith", "specialty": "Cardiology", "hospital_id": "H001"},
    {"doctor_id": "D002", "name": "Dr. Johnson", "specialty": "Orthopedics", "hospital_id": "H002"}
]

# BCBS companies sharing resources
bcbs_companies = [
    {"company_id": "C001", "name": "BCBS Springfield", "shared_office": True},
    {"company_id": "C002", "name": "BCBS Rivertown", "shared_office": True}
]

# Enrollment data
members = [
    {"member_id": "M001", "name": "Alice", "plan": "Basic", "company_id": "C001"},
    {"member_id": "M002", "name": "Bob", "plan": "Premium", "company_id": "C002"}
]

=== Step 3: Functional Operations for Data Management

#### Pure Function: Mapping Doctors to Hospitals

[source,python]
----
def map_doctors_to_hospitals(doctors, hospitals):
    """Map doctors to their respective hospitals."""
    return [
        {
            **doctor,
            "hospital_name": next(
                (hospital["name"] for hospital in hospitals if hospital["hospital_id"] == doctor["hospital_id"]),
                "Unknown"
            )
        }
        for doctor in doctors
    ]

# Test the function
mapped_doctors = map_doctors_to_hospitals(doctors, hospitals)
print("Mapped Doctors:", mapped_doctors)
----

#### Higher-Order Function: Filter Shared Resources

[source,python]
----
def filter_shared_resources(companies, filter_func):
    """Filter companies based on a condition."""
    return list(filter(filter_func, companies))

# Test the function
shared_office_companies = filter_shared_resources(bcbs_companies, lambda c: c["shared_office"])
print("Companies Sharing Offices:", shared_office_companies)
----

#### Composing Enrollment Data

[source,python]
----
def enrich_member_data(members, companies):
    """Enrich members with company names."""
    return [
        {
            **member,
            "company_name": next(
                (company["name"] for company in companies if company["company_id"] == member["company_id"]),
                "Unknown"
            )
        }
        for member in members
    ]

# Test the function
enriched_members = enrich_member_data(members, bcbs_companies)
print("Enriched Members:", enriched_members)
----

=== Step 4: Joint Enrollment and Billing

#### Function Composition: Calculate Total Members and Premium Revenue

[source,python]
----
def calculate_revenue_by_company(members, plans):
    """Calculate total revenue by company based on member plans."""
    return {
        company_id: sum(plans[member["plan"]] for member in members if member["company_id"] == company_id)
        for company_id in {member["company_id"] for member in members}
    }

# Define plan rates
plan_rates = {"Basic": 100, "Premium": 200}

# Test the function
revenue_by_company = calculate_revenue_by_company(members, plan_rates)
print("Revenue by Company:", revenue_by_company)
----

=== Step 5: Sharing Office Space and Resources

#### Aggregating Shared Resource Usage

[source,python]
----
def aggregate_shared_resources(companies):
    """Aggregate shared resources among BCBS companies."""
    return len([company for company in companies if company["shared_office"]])

# Test the function
shared_resource_count = aggregate_shared_resources(bcbs_companies)
print("Total Companies Sharing Resources:", shared_resource_count)
----

=== Step 6: End-to-End Pipeline

#### Process All Data Together

[source,python]
----
def process_bcbs_data(doctors, hospitals, members, companies):
    """Process BCBS data to produce final insights."""
    # Step 1: Map doctors to hospitals
    mapped_doctors = map_doctors_to_hospitals(doctors, hospitals)

    # Step 2: Enrich members with company data
    enriched_members = enrich_member_data(members, companies)

    # Step 3: Calculate revenue by company
    plan_rates = {"Basic": 100, "Premium": 200}
    revenue = calculate_revenue_by_company(members, plan_rates)

    return {
        "mapped_doctors": mapped_doctors,
        "enriched_members": enriched_members,
        "revenue": revenue
    }

# Run the pipeline
final_data = process_bcbs_data(doctors, hospitals, members, bcbs_companies)
print("Final Data:", final_data)
----

=== Step 7: Summary

- **Pure Functions**: Ensure predictable operations like mapping doctors to hospitals.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Reuse logic for filtering and enrichment.
- **Data Composition**: Build enriched and aggregated insights like member data and revenue.
- **Real-World Applicability**: Demonstrated a complete pipeline for BCBS operations using functional programming principles.
