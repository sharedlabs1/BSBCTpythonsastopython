== Beginner Case Study: Understanding Data Types, Sequence Types, and PEP 8 Standards

=== Objective
Introduce beginners to Python programming with a focus on:

1. Data types and their usage.
2. Sequence types (list, tuple, string, dictionary, and set).
3. Writing clean, readable code following PEP 8 standards.
4. Comparison of Python operations with SAS equivalents for better context.

=== Step 1: Introduction to Data Types

[source,python]
----
# Python has dynamic typing, meaning variables do not need explicit type declarations.
# Common data types:

# Integer
age = 25  # Example of an integer

# Float
salary = 45750.75  # Example of a floating-point number

# String
name = "John Doe"  # Example of a string

# Boolean
is_employee = True  # Example of a boolean value

print("Age:", type(age))
print("Salary:", type(salary))
print("Name:", type(name))
print("Is Employee:", type(is_employee))
----

=== SAS Comparison: Data Types

[source,sas]
----
/* SAS uses explicit typing for variables within data steps. */

DATA example;
    age = 25; /* Numeric variable */
    salary = 45750.75; /* Numeric variable */
    name = "John Doe"; /* Character variable */
    is_employee = 1; /* Numeric, often 0/1 for boolean-like operations */
RUN;

PROC PRINT DATA=example;
RUN;
----

=== Step 2: Sequence Types

[source,python]
----
# Python's sequence types are powerful and versatile.

# List: Mutable sequence of items
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
fruits.append("Date")  # Add an item

# Tuple: Immutable sequence of items
coordinates = (34.0522, -118.2437)  # Latitude and longitude

# String: Immutable sequence of characters
message = "Hello, World!"
substring = message[0:5]  # Slicing strings

# Set: Unordered collection of unique items
unique_fruits = set(fruits)

# Dictionary: Key-value pairs
employee = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 25, "salary": 45750.75}

print("List:", fruits)
print("Tuple:", coordinates)
print("Substring:", substring)
print("Set:", unique_fruits)
print("Dictionary:", employee)
----

=== SAS Comparison: Sequence Types

[source,sas]
----
/* SAS does not natively support sequence types like Python but achieves similar results with arrays or tables. */

/* Array in SAS */
DATA array_example;
    ARRAY fruits[4] $12 _TEMPORARY_ ("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date");
    DO i = 1 TO DIM(fruits);
        PUT fruits[i];
    END;
RUN;

/* Key-value structures in SAS can be approximated with hash objects. */
DATA _NULL_;
    DECLARE HASH employee();
    employee.DEFINEKEY("key");
    employee.DEFINEVALUE("value");
    employee.DEFINEDONE();
    employee.ADD(KEY:"name", VALUE:"John Doe");
    employee.ADD(KEY:"age", VALUE:25);
    employee.ADD(KEY:"salary", VALUE:45750.75);
    employee.OUTPUT(DATASET:"employee_data");
RUN;

PROC PRINT DATA=employee_data;
RUN;
----

=== Step 3: Writing Clean Code with PEP 8

[source,python]
----
# Following PEP 8 ensures your Python code is readable and maintainable.

# Example of PEP 8-compliant code:
def calculate_bonus(salary, percentage):
    """Calculate bonus based on salary and percentage."""
    bonus = salary * (percentage / 100)
    return bonus

# Call the function
employee_bonus = calculate_bonus(salary=45750.75, percentage=10)
print(f"Bonus: ${employee_bonus:.2f}")

# Common PEP 8 Practices:
# 1. Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
# 2. Limit lines to 79 characters.
# 3. Use descriptive variable names.
# 4. Leave a blank line between functions or class definitions.
----

=== SAS Comparison: Code Readability

[source,sas]
----
/* SAS emphasizes proper indentation for readability, although it does not have strict style guides like PEP 8. */

%MACRO calculate_bonus(salary, percentage);
    %LET bonus = %SYSEVALF(&salary * (&percentage / 100));
    %PUT Bonus: &bonus;
%MEND;

%calculate_bonus(45750.75, 10);
----

=== Step 4: Summary

- Python's dynamic typing makes it easy to start with data types.
- Sequence types provide powerful tools for organizing and manipulating data.
- PEP 8 guidelines help ensure your code is clean, readable, and maintainable.
- SAS provides comparable functionality but often requires explicit setups, such as arrays or hash objects, to achieve similar results.
