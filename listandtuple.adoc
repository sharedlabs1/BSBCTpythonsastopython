== Case Study: Mastering Lists and Tuples in Python (Insurance Domain)

=== Objective
Provide a detailed exploration of Python lists and tuples by:

1. Understanding their definitions and differences.
2. Demonstrating core functionalities with examples.
3. Applying advanced operations.
4. Using real-world scenarios in the insurance domain.

=== Scenario: Insurance Policy and Claims Data Management
Manage and manipulate insurance policies and claims data effectively using lists and tuples.

=== Step 1: Introduction to Lists and Tuples

==== List Basics

[source,python]
----
# Example: List of policy IDs
policy_ids = ["POL12345", "POL12346", "POL12347"]

# Adding a new policy ID
policy_ids.append("POL12348")

# Removing a policy ID
policy_ids.remove("POL12345")

# Accessing elements
print("First Policy ID:", policy_ids[0])
print("All Policy IDs:", policy_ids)
----

==== Tuple Basics

[source,python]
----
# Example: Tuple of risk categories
risk_categories = ("Low", "Medium", "High")

# Accessing elements
print("First Risk Category:", risk_categories[0])
print("All Risk Categories:", risk_categories)

# Attempting to modify a tuple (this will raise an error)
try:
    risk_categories[0] = "Very Low"
except TypeError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
----

==== Key Differences
- Lists are mutable; tuples are immutable.
- Tuples use less memory and are faster for fixed data.

=== Step 2: Common Operations on Lists

[source,python]
----
# Example: Managing a list of claim amounts
claim_amounts = [1500, 2500, 3500, 4500, 5500]

# Adding claims
claim_amounts.append(6500)

# Inserting a claim at a specific position
claim_amounts.insert(2, 3000)

# Removing claims
claim_amounts.pop(1)  # Removes the second claim

# Sorting claims
claim_amounts.sort(reverse=True)  # Descending order

print("Claim Amounts:", claim_amounts)
----

=== Step 3: Common Operations on Tuples

[source,python]
----
# Example: Tuple of policy types
policy_types = ("Life", "Health", "Vehicle", "Property")

# Counting occurrences
print("Occurrences of 'Health':", policy_types.count("Health"))

# Finding an index
print("Index of 'Vehicle':", policy_types.index("Vehicle"))
----

=== Step 4: Advanced List Operations

==== List Comprehensions

[source,python]
----
# Example: Calculate premiums with a list comprehension
base_premiums = [1000, 1200, 1500, 2000]
risk_factors = [1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8]

final_premiums = [base * risk for base, risk in zip(base_premiums, risk_factors)]
print("Final Premiums:", final_premiums)
----

==== Nested Lists

[source,python]
----
# Example: Claims grouped by risk levels
claims_by_risk = [
    [1500, 2500],  # Low risk
    [3500, 4500],  # Medium risk
    [5500, 6500]   # High risk
]

# Accessing nested elements
print("High Risk Claims:", claims_by_risk[2])
----

=== Step 5: Advanced Tuple Operations

==== Nested Tuples

[source,python]
----
# Example: Policy details stored in tuples
policy_details = (
    ("POL12345", "John Doe", 1500),
    ("POL12346", "Jane Smith", 2500),
    ("POL12347", "Jim Brown", 3500)
)

# Accessing nested elements
print("First Policy Details:", policy_details[0])
print("Policy Holder of Second Policy:", policy_details[1][1])
----

==== Tuple Unpacking

[source,python]
----
# Example: Unpacking policy details
policy_id, policy_holder, claim_amount = policy_details[0]
print(f"Policy ID: {policy_id}, Holder: {policy_holder}, Claim: ${claim_amount}")
----

=== Step 6: Combining Lists and Tuples

[source,python]
----
# Example: Combining lists and tuples for policy management
policies = [
    ("POL12345", "John Doe", "Life"),
    ("POL12346", "Jane Smith", "Health"),
    ("POL12347", "Jim Brown", "Vehicle")
]

# Adding a new policy
policies.append(("POL12348", "Jake White", "Property"))

# Filtering policies based on type
life_policies = [policy for policy in policies if policy[2] == "Life"]
print("Life Policies:", life_policies)
----

=== Step 7: Real-World Example: Claim Processing Pipeline

[source,python]
----
# Example: Process claims data with lists and tuples
claims_data = [
    ("POL12345", 1500, "Low"),
    ("POL12346", 2500, "Medium"),
    ("POL12347", 3500, "High"),
    ("POL12348", 4500, "High")
]

# Filter high-risk claims
high_risk_claims = [claim for claim in claims_data if claim[2] == "High"]

# Calculate total high-risk claims
total_high_risk = sum(claim[1] for claim in high_risk_claims)

print("High Risk Claims:", high_risk_claims)
print("Total High Risk Claims:", total_high_risk)
----

=== Step 8: Summary

- Lists and tuples are versatile data structures for managing collections of data.
- Lists are mutable and suitable for dynamic collections, while tuples are immutable and ideal for fixed data.
- Combining lists and tuples enables efficient management of complex data in real-world scenarios, such as insurance policies and claims.
