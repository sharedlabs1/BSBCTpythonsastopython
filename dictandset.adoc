== Case Study: Mastering Dictionaries and Sets in Python (Insurance Domain)

=== Objective
Provide a comprehensive exploration of Python dictionaries and sets by:

1. Understanding their definitions and differences.
2. Demonstrating core functionalities with examples.
3. Applying advanced operations.
4. Using real-world scenarios in the insurance domain.

=== Scenario: Insurance Policy and Claims Data Management
Efficiently manage and analyze insurance policy and claims data using dictionaries and sets.

=== Step 1: Introduction to Dictionaries and Sets

==== Dictionary Basics

[source,python]
----
# Example: Dictionary of policy details
policy_details = {
    "POL12345": {"holder": "John Doe", "premium": 1500},
    "POL12346": {"holder": "Jane Smith", "premium": 2500},
    "POL12347": {"holder": "Jim Brown", "premium": 3500}
}

# Accessing policy details
print("Policy Holder for POL12345:", policy_details["POL12345"]["holder"])

# Adding a new policy
policy_details["POL12348"] = {"holder": "Jake White", "premium": 4500}

# Removing a policy
del policy_details["POL12345"]

print("Updated Policy Details:", policy_details)
----

==== Set Basics

[source,python]
----
# Example: Set of active policies
active_policies = {"POL12345", "POL12346", "POL12347"}

# Adding a new policy to the set
active_policies.add("POL12348")

# Removing a policy from the set
active_policies.discard("POL12345")

# Checking membership
print("Is POL12346 active?:", "POL12346" in active_policies)

print("Active Policies:", active_policies)
----

==== Key Differences
- Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs.
- Sets store unique, unordered elements and are ideal for membership tests and unique collections.

=== Step 2: Common Operations on Dictionaries

[source,python]
----
# Example: Managing claims using a dictionary
claims = {
    "POL12345": 1500,
    "POL12346": 2500,
    "POL12347": 3500
}

# Updating claim amounts
claims["POL12345"] += 500  # Adding an adjustment

# Iterating over dictionary items
for policy, amount in claims.items():
    print(f"Policy {policy} has a claim of ${amount}")

# Getting a value with a default
print("Claim for POL12348:", claims.get("POL12348", "No claim found"))
----

=== Step 3: Common Operations on Sets

[source,python]
----
# Example: Operations with active and expired policies
expired_policies = {"POL12345", "POL12349"}

# Union of active and expired policies
all_policies = active_policies.union(expired_policies)
print("All Policies:", all_policies)

# Intersection of active and expired policies
common_policies = active_policies.intersection(expired_policies)
print("Common Policies:", common_policies)

# Difference between active and expired policies
only_active = active_policies.difference(expired_policies)
print("Only Active Policies:", only_active)
----

=== Step 4: Advanced Dictionary Operations

==== Dictionary Comprehensions

[source,python]
----
# Example: Creating a dictionary of premiums above a threshold
premiums = {"POL12345": 1500, "POL12346": 2500, "POL12347": 3500}
high_premiums = {policy: amount for policy, amount in premiums.items() if amount > 2000}
print("High Premiums:", high_premiums)
----

==== Nested Dictionaries

[source,python]
----
# Example: Nested dictionary for detailed claims data
claims_data = {
    "POL12345": {"amount": 1500, "status": "Pending"},
    "POL12346": {"amount": 2500, "status": "Approved"},
    "POL12347": {"amount": 3500, "status": "Denied"}
}

# Accessing nested data
print("Claim Amount for POL12346:", claims_data["POL12346"]["amount"])

# Updating claim status
claims_data["POL12345"]["status"] = "Approved"
print("Updated Claims Data:", claims_data)
----

=== Step 5: Advanced Set Operations

==== Set Comprehensions

[source,python]
----
# Example: Creating a set of high-risk policies
high_risk_claims = {"POL12345", "POL12347", "POL12348"}
high_risk_set = {policy for policy in high_risk_claims if "7" in policy}
print("High Risk Policies:", high_risk_set)
----

==== Frozen Sets

[source,python]
----
# Example: Using frozen sets for immutable collections
frozen_active_policies = frozenset(active_policies)
print("Frozen Active Policies:", frozen_active_policies)

# Attempting to modify (this will raise an error)
try:
    frozen_active_policies.add("POL12349")
except AttributeError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
----

=== Step 6: Combining Dictionaries and Sets

[source,python]
----
# Example: Managing policies with dictionaries and sets
policy_details = {
    "POL12345": {"holder": "John Doe", "premium": 1500},
    "POL12346": {"holder": "Jane Smith", "premium": 2500},
    "POL12347": {"holder": "Jim Brown", "premium": 3500}
}

active_policies = {"POL12345", "POL12346"}

# Finding active policy details
active_policy_details = {policy: policy_details[policy] for policy in active_policies}
print("Active Policy Details:", active_policy_details)
----

=== Step 7: Real-World Example: Policy Processing Pipeline

[source,python]
----
# Example: Policy processing pipeline using dictionaries and sets
policies = {
    "POL12345": {"holder": "John Doe", "premium": 1500, "status": "Active"},
    "POL12346": {"holder": "Jane Smith", "premium": 2500, "status": "Expired"},
    "POL12347": {"holder": "Jim Brown", "premium": 3500, "status": "Active"}
}

# Extract active policies
active_policies = {policy for policy, details in policies.items() if details["status"] == "Active"}

# Calculate total premiums for active policies
total_premium = sum(policies[policy]["premium"] for policy in active_policies)

print("Active Policies:", active_policies)
print("Total Premium for Active Policies:", total_premium)
----

=== Step 8: Summary

- Dictionaries and sets are powerful tools for managing structured and unstructured data.
- Dictionaries store key-value pairs and allow complex data modeling with nested structures.
- Sets are ideal for unique collections, membership testing, and mathematical operations.
- Combining dictionaries and sets enables efficient, real-world data management, such as insurance policy and claim processing.
