== Lab: Data Analytics Using Functional Programming

=== Objective
This lab focuses on data analytics using functional programming principles. Key goals include:

1. Extracting insights from data.
2. Building a composable pipeline for analytics.
3. Applying pure functions, higher-order functions, and data transformations.

=== Scenario: Healthcare Analytics for BCBS
You are tasked with performing data analytics for BCBS (Blue Cross Blue Shield) operations. The tasks include:

1. Analyzing hospital and doctor collaboration.
2. Calculating company revenue from member data.
3. Identifying shared resources among companies.
4. Generating a summary of actionable insights.

=== Step 1: Setting Up Data

[source,python]
----
# Sample data for hospitals, doctors, and members
hospitals = [
    {"hospital_id": "H001", "name": "Community Hospital", "city": "Springfield"},
    {"hospital_id": "H002", "name": "Central Medical Center", "city": "Rivertown"}
]

doctors = [
    {"doctor_id": "D001", "name": "Dr. Smith", "specialty": "Cardiology", "hospital_id": "H001"},
    {"doctor_id": "D002", "name": "Dr. Johnson", "specialty": "Orthopedics", "hospital_id": "H002"}
]

bcbs_companies = [
    {"company_id": "C001", "name": "BCBS Springfield", "shared_office": True},
    {"company_id": "C002", "name": "BCBS Rivertown", "shared_office": False}
]

members = [
    {"member_id": "M001", "name": "Alice", "plan": "Basic", "company_id": "C001"},
    {"member_id": "M002", "name": "Bob", "plan": "Premium", "company_id": "C002"}
]

# Plan rates for revenue calculation
plan_rates = {"Basic": 100, "Premium": 200}

=== Step 2: Data Transformation with Functional Programming

#### Mapping Doctors to Hospitals

[source,python]
----
def map_doctors_to_hospitals(doctors, hospitals):
    """Map each doctor to their respective hospital."""
    return [
        {
            **doctor,
            "hospital_name": next(
                (hospital["name"] for hospital in hospitals if hospital["hospital_id"] == doctor["hospital_id"]),
                "Unknown"
            )
        }
        for doctor in doctors
    ]

# Test mapping function
mapped_doctors = map_doctors_to_hospitals(doctors, hospitals)
print("Mapped Doctors:", mapped_doctors)
----

#### Enriching Member Data

[source,python]
----
def enrich_member_data(members, companies):
    """Add company name to each member record."""
    return [
        {
            **member,
            "company_name": next(
                (company["name"] for company in companies if company["company_id"] == member["company_id"]),
                "Unknown"
            )
        }
        for member in members
    ]

# Test enrichment function
enriched_members = enrich_member_data(members, bcbs_companies)
print("Enriched Members:", enriched_members)
----

=== Step 3: Revenue Calculation

#### Aggregating Revenue by Company

[source,python]
----
def calculate_revenue_by_company(members, plan_rates):
    """Calculate total revenue for each company."""
    return {
        company_id: sum(plan_rates[member["plan"]] for member in members if member["company_id"] == company_id)
        for company_id in {member["company_id"] for member in members}
    }

# Test revenue calculation
revenue_by_company = calculate_revenue_by_company(members, plan_rates)
print("Revenue by Company:", revenue_by_company)
----

=== Step 4: Resource Analysis

#### Counting Companies Sharing Resources

[source,python]
----
def count_shared_resources(companies):
    """Count the number of companies sharing office resources."""
    return len([company for company in companies if company["shared_office"]])

# Test resource count
shared_resource_count = count_shared_resources(bcbs_companies)
print("Companies Sharing Resources:", shared_resource_count)
----

=== Step 5: Building an Analytics Pipeline

#### Combining All Steps

[source,python]
----
def healthcare_analytics_pipeline(doctors, hospitals, members, companies, plan_rates):
    """Perform end-to-end analytics for BCBS data."""
    # Step 1: Map doctors to hospitals
    mapped_doctors = map_doctors_to_hospitals(doctors, hospitals)

    # Step 2: Enrich member data
    enriched_members = enrich_member_data(members, companies)

    # Step 3: Calculate revenue
    revenue = calculate_revenue_by_company(members, plan_rates)

    # Step 4: Analyze shared resources
    shared_resource_count = count_shared_resources(companies)

    return {
        "mapped_doctors": mapped_doctors,
        "enriched_members": enriched_members,
        "revenue": revenue,
        "shared_resource_count": shared_resource_count
    }

# Execute the pipeline
analytics_results = healthcare_analytics_pipeline(doctors, hospitals, members, bcbs_companies, plan_rates)
print("Analytics Results:", analytics_results)
----

=== Step 6: Insights and Summary

#### Insights
1. **Doctor-Hospital Mapping**: Understand the distribution of doctors across hospitals.
2. **Enriched Member Data**: Identify company affiliations for all members.
3. **Revenue Analysis**: Calculate revenue generated by each company.
4. **Shared Resources**: Determine collaboration levels among companies.

#### Summary
- Functional programming principles like pure functions and higher-order functions enable efficient data transformations.
- Composing functions into an analytics pipeline ensures modular and maintainable code.
- The real-world scenario of BCBS highlights practical applications of data analytics in healthcare.
