== Lab: Functional Programming in Python

=== Objective
Provide a detailed guide to functional programming in Python, focusing on:

1. Features of functional programming.
2. Pure functions and immutability.
3. Higher-order functions and using functions as arguments/return values.
4. Scope of variables in functional programming.

=== Step 1: Introduction to Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm where functions are treated as first-class citizens and computation is performed using mathematical functions. Key principles include:

- **Immutability**: Data is not modified after creation.
- **Pure Functions**: Functions produce the same output for the same input without side effects.
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions can be passed as arguments, returned as values, and stored in variables.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

=== Step 2: Pure Functions

#### What is a Pure Function?
- A function is considered pure if:
  - It has no side effects.
  - The output depends solely on the input.

[source,python]
----
# Example: Pure Function

def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Adds two numbers without modifying external state."""
    return a + b

print(add_numbers(2, 3))  # Always produces 5

# Example: Impure Function
result = 0

def add_to_result(value):
    """Adds value to a global variable (impure)."""
    global result
    result += value
    return result

print(add_to_result(5))  # Depends on external state
----

#### Key Benefits of Pure Functions
- Easier to test and debug.
- More predictable behavior.
- Suitable for parallel processing.

=== Step 3: Immutability

#### Mutable vs Immutable Data Types
- **Immutable**: Data cannot be changed (e.g., `int`, `tuple`, `str`).
- **Mutable**: Data can be changed (e.g., `list`, `dict`).

[source,python]
----
# Example: Immutable Data
x = (1, 2, 3)
try:
    x[0] = 10
except TypeError as e:
    print("Error:", e)

# Example: Mutable Data
y = [1, 2, 3]
y[0] = 10
print(y)  # [10, 2, 3]
----

#### Immutability in Functional Programming
- Avoid mutating data to ensure predictable results.
- Use immutable types like `tuple` or functional libraries like `frozenset`.

=== Step 4: Higher-Order Functions

#### What is a Higher-Order Function?
- A function that:
  - Takes another function as an argument.
  - Returns a function as a result.

#### Using Functions as Arguments

[source,python]
----
# Example: Using a Function as an Argument

def apply_function(func, value):
    """Applies a function to a value."""
    return func(value)

# Function to double a number
def double(x):
    return x * 2

print(apply_function(double, 5))  # Output: 10
----

#### Returning a Function

[source,python]
----
# Example: Returning a Function

def multiplier(factor):
    """Returns a function that multiplies by the given factor."""
    def multiply(value):
        return value * factor
    return multiply

# Create a function that triples a value
triple = multiplier(3)
print(triple(5))  # Output: 15
----

=== Step 5: Scope of Variables

#### Variable Scope in Python
- **Local Scope**: Variables defined inside a function.
- **Global Scope**: Variables defined outside any function.
- **Nonlocal Scope**: Variables in an enclosing function for nested functions.

[source,python]
----
# Example: Local, Global, and Nonlocal Scope
x = 10  # Global variable

def outer_function():
    y = 20  # Enclosing variable

    def inner_function():
        nonlocal y
        y += 5
        print("Inner y:", y)

    inner_function()
    print("Outer y:", y)

outer_function()
print("Global x:", x)
----

=== Step 6: Real-World Case Study: Insurance Premium Calculator

[source,python]
----
# Step 1: Pure Function to Calculate Premium
def calculate_premium(base, risk_factor):
    return base * risk_factor

# Step 2: Higher-Order Function to Apply Discounts
def apply_discount(discount_func, premium):
    return discount_func(premium)

# Discount Function
def ten_percent_discount(premium):
    return premium * 0.9

# Step 3: Returning a Function for Tax Calculation
def tax_calculator(tax_rate):
    def calculate_tax(amount):
        return amount * tax_rate
    return calculate_tax

# Step 4: Combining All Concepts
premium = calculate_premium(1000, 1.2)
premium_after_discount = apply_discount(ten_percent_discount, premium)
calculate_tax = tax_calculator(0.05)
total_with_tax = premium_after_discount + calculate_tax(premium_after_discount)

print(f"Base Premium: {premium}")
print(f"Premium After Discount: {premium_after_discount}")
print(f"Total with Tax: {total_with_tax}")
----

=== Step 7: Summary

- Functional programming promotes immutability and pure functions for predictable results.
- Higher-order functions allow flexible and reusable code by operating on other functions.
- Understanding variable scope is crucial for avoiding unintended side effects.
- Applying these principles can simplify complex real-world problems, as shown in the case study.
