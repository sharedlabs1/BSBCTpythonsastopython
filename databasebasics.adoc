== Lab: Database Basics with Python

=== Objective
This lab introduces the basics of working with relational databases in Python. You will:

1. Set up a SQLite database.
2. Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
3. Use SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval.

=== Step 1: Setting Up SQLite

#### What is SQLite?
SQLite is a lightweight, file-based relational database management system. It is included with Python, making it ideal for learning and small projects.

#### Installing SQLite
SQLite is pre-installed with Python. To check, run:

[source,bash]
----
python -c "import sqlite3; print('SQLite is available')"
----

=== Step 2: Connecting to a Database

#### Creating and Connecting to a SQLite Database

[source,python]
----
import sqlite3

# Connect to SQLite database (creates the database file if it doesn't exist)
connection = sqlite3.connect("insurance.db")

# Create a cursor to interact with the database
cursor = connection.cursor()

print("Connected to database successfully")
----

=== Step 3: Creating Tables

#### Define a Table for Policies

[source,python]
----
# SQL query to create a table
create_table_query = """
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS policies (
    policy_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    policy_holder TEXT NOT NULL,
    policy_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    premium REAL NOT NULL
);
"""

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(create_table_query)
print("Table 'policies' created successfully")
----

=== Step 4: Inserting Data

#### Insert Records into the Table

[source,python]
----
# Sample data
policy_data = [
    ("POL12345", "John Doe", "Life", 1200.50),
    ("POL12346", "Jane Smith", "Health", 2500.75),
    ("POL12347", "Jim Brown", "Vehicle", 1800.00)
]

# SQL query to insert data
insert_query = "INSERT INTO policies (policy_id, policy_holder, policy_type, premium) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?);"

# Insert data
cursor.executemany(insert_query, policy_data)
connection.commit()
print("Data inserted successfully")
----

=== Step 5: Querying Data

#### Retrieve Data from the Table

[source,python]
----
# SQL query to select all records
select_query = "SELECT * FROM policies;"

# Execute the query and fetch all results
cursor.execute(select_query)
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Display the results
print("Policies:")
for row in rows:
    print(row)
----

=== Step 6: Updating Data

#### Update a Record

[source,python]
----
# SQL query to update a record
update_query = "UPDATE policies SET premium = ? WHERE policy_id = ?;"

# Update the premium for a specific policy
cursor.execute(update_query, (1400.00, "POL12345"))
connection.commit()
print("Policy updated successfully")
----

=== Step 7: Deleting Data

#### Delete a Record

[source,python]
----
# SQL query to delete a record
delete_query = "DELETE FROM policies WHERE policy_id = ?;"

# Delete a policy by ID
cursor.execute(delete_query, ("POL12347",))
connection.commit()
print("Policy deleted successfully")
----

=== Step 8: Closing the Connection

#### Always Close the Database Connection

[source,python]
----
# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
connection.close()
print("Database connection closed")
----

=== Step 9: Summary

- SQLite is an easy-to-use database for small projects and learning.
- CRUD operations allow you to interact with data effectively.
- Always ensure you close database connections to avoid resource leaks.

You now have a basic understanding of working with databases in Python!
