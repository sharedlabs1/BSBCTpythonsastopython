== Lab: Functional Programming in Python (Case-Driven)

=== Objective
Explore functional programming in Python through a case-driven approach, focusing on:

1. Principles of functional programming.
2. Application of pure functions and immutability.
3. Usage of higher-order functions and function composition.
4. Managing variable scope in real-world scenarios.

=== Scenario: Insurance Claim Processing System

You are tasked with creating a Python-based system for an insurance company. The system must:

- Calculate premiums for various policies.
- Apply discounts based on policy type.
- Add taxes to the final premium amount.
- Ensure all calculations are performed using functional programming principles.

=== Step 1: Setting Up Data and Problem Statement

Define the initial data and objective.

[source,python]
----
# Initial data: List of policies with base premiums and policy types
policies = [
    {"policy_id": "POL12345", "base_premium": 1000, "policy_type": "Life"},
    {"policy_id": "POL12346", "base_premium": 1500, "policy_type": "Health"},
    {"policy_id": "POL12347", "base_premium": 2000, "policy_type": "Vehicle"}
]

# Objective: Calculate the final premium for each policy after discounts and taxes.
----

=== Step 2: Pure Function for Premium Calculation

#### Create a pure function to calculate premiums based on a risk factor.

[source,python]
----
# Pure function for premium calculation
def calculate_premium(base_premium, risk_factor):
    """Calculate the premium based on base amount and risk factor."""
    return base_premium * risk_factor

# Test the function
print(calculate_premium(1000, 1.2))  # Output: 1200
----

=== Step 3: Applying Discounts Using Higher-Order Functions

#### Define a higher-order function to apply discounts based on policy type.

[source,python]
----
# Discount functions for different policy types
def life_discount(premium):
    return premium * 0.95

def health_discount(premium):
    return premium * 0.90

def vehicle_discount(premium):
    return premium * 0.85

# Higher-order function to apply discount based on policy type
def apply_discount(policy, discount_func):
    """Apply a discount to the premium based on policy type."""
    premium = policy["base_premium"]
    return discount_func(premium)

# Test with a policy
policy = {"policy_id": "POL12345", "base_premium": 1000, "policy_type": "Life"}
print(apply_discount(policy, life_discount))  # Output: 950
----

=== Step 4: Returning a Function for Tax Calculation

#### Create a function that returns another function to calculate taxes.

[source,python]
----
# Function returning a tax calculator
def tax_calculator(tax_rate):
    """Return a function to calculate tax on a given amount."""
    def calculate_tax(amount):
        return amount * tax_rate
    return calculate_tax

# Test the tax calculator
calculate_tax = tax_calculator(0.05)  # 5% tax
print(calculate_tax(1000))  # Output: 50
----

=== Step 5: Combining All Steps

#### Build the final pipeline to calculate the total premium for all policies.

[source,python]
----
# Function to process a single policy
def process_policy(policy, discount_funcs, tax_func):
    """Process a policy to calculate the final premium."""
    policy_type = policy["policy_type"].lower()
    discount_func = discount_funcs.get(policy_type, lambda x: x)  # Default: no discount

    # Step 1: Calculate the premium
    base_premium = policy["base_premium"]
    premium = calculate_premium(base_premium, 1.2)  # Assume risk factor = 1.2

    # Step 2: Apply discount
    premium_after_discount = discount_func(premium)

    # Step 3: Add tax
    total_premium = premium_after_discount + tax_func(premium_after_discount)

    return {"policy_id": policy["policy_id"], "total_premium": total_premium}

# Mapping policy types to discount functions
discount_funcs = {
    "life": life_discount,
    "health": health_discount,
    "vehicle": vehicle_discount
}

# Tax function
tax_func = tax_calculator(0.05)

# Process all policies
processed_policies = [process_policy(policy, discount_funcs, tax_func) for policy in policies]

print("Processed Policies:", processed_policies)
----

=== Step 6: Understanding Variable Scope

#### Demonstrate local, global, and nonlocal scopes.

[source,python]
----
# Example of variable scopes
x = 10  # Global variable

def outer_function():
    y = 20  # Enclosing variable

    def inner_function():
        nonlocal y
        y += 5
        print("Inner y:", y)  # Access enclosing variable

    inner_function()
    print("Outer y:", y)  # Modified by inner_function

outer_function()
print("Global x:", x)
----

=== Step 7: Summary

- Functional programming enables clean, predictable, and reusable code.
- Pure functions and immutability minimize side effects and make debugging easier.
- Higher-order functions allow flexible operations like applying discounts and taxes dynamically.
- Understanding variable scope helps manage data effectively in nested functions.

=== Step 8: Run and Verify

To run the lab, save the code as `functional_programming_lab.py` and execute it using:

[source,bash]
----
python functional_programming_lab.py
----

Verify the outputs match the expected results for each policy processed.
